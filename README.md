In this project, I simulated a 4-DOF SCARA type (RRPR) manipulator, shown below. the project is divided into different sections: First is basic Matrix Computation Routines. Second, Forward and inverse Kinematics. Thirdly, Trajectory planning and collision-free path planning. Fourthly, Multi-object picking.

During my project, I accomplished the following tasks: I created a mathematical model for the robot arm, employing D-H notation, and implemented both forward and inverse kinematics. Additionally, I programmed a path planning algorithm in C++ that effectively regulated speed and acceleration utilizing diverse techniques like cubic splines, parabolic bending, and single polynomial. To evaluate the performance of the robot, I simulated its motion along multiple paths and examined the joint space outcomes using MATLAB. Lastly, I efficiently utilized GitHub as a collaborative platform, enabling seamless communication, updates, and code editing with my peers.
